# How to export using EasyHTML

Exporting in EasyHTML is a bit weird. I get that. But here is a step by step guide on how to do it!

Once you finish coding up your website in the editor, head over to the tab called "Export". There, you will see a box with all the finished code. **You will not be able to highlight the code**. Instead, click the button labeled "Export" at the bottom right. Once you do, a file explorer will open, and you can save it where you want to. Once you save it, you can navagate to the file in the File explorer, and there is your file! :\)

Here is a sample file created using EasyHTML: [Sample File](https://thecrafters001.github.io/docs/samples/EasyHTML/ExportSample-EasyHTML-one.html)

Happy coding!
